# Cipher Program
This repository includes cryptography program using two traditional cipher method which are Caesar cipher and transposition cipher.

1) caesarcipher.py contains program to encrypt and decrypt message input by user using Caesar cipher cryptography technique. User can choose to use either encrypt or decrypt mode. User can also specify the key to be used.

2) hackcaesar.py contains program to decrypt cipher text input by user using bruteforce method. The output would be the key used for encryption and the original plain text itself.

3) transpositionEncrypt.py contains program to encrypt message input by user using transposition cipher technique. User can specify the key to be used.

4) transpositionDecrypt.py contains program to decrypt message input by user using transposition cipher technique. User can specify the key to be used.

5) transpositionFileCipher.py contains program to encrypt or decrypt text file using transposition cipher technique. User need to specify the name of the input file and the output file. User also need to make sure that the path of the input file is correct. User can choose to use either encrypt or decrypt mode. User can also specify the key to be used.

6) transpositionTest.py contains program to test the encryption/decryption program in number 3 and 4.
